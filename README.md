## üåü Features

- üÜì **Completely Free** - No API keys, no costs, no limits
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered** - Uses Hugging Face transformers (optional)
- üîß **Smart Fallback** - Works even without AI models installed
- üìä **Multiple Modes** - AI enhancement or rule-based improvements
- üéØ **Type-Aware** - Optimizes for coding, math, analysis, creative tasks
- ‚ö° **Fast & Reliable** - Works offline once models are downloaded

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Installation (No Dependencies)
```bash
# Clone or download
git clone https://github.com/coxaiservices/free-ai-prompt-improver.git
cd free-ai-prompt-improver

# Works immediately with zero dependencies!
python3 free_ai_improver.py "Write a sorting function"
```

### Enhanced Installation (With AI Models)
```bash
# Install AI dependencies for enhanced mode
pip install transformers torch

# Now you get AI-powered improvements
python3 free_ai_improver.py "Write a sorting function"
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Improve any prompt
python3 free_ai_improver.py "Calculate compound interest"

# Show before/after comparison
python3 free_ai_improver.py "Analyze climate data" --compare

# Force rule-based mode (skip AI)
python3 free_ai_improver.py "Create a web app" --manual

# See example improvements
python3 free_ai_improver.py --examples
```

### Real Examples

**Before:**
```
"Write a sorting function"
```

**After:**
```
Write a Python sorting function

Requirements:
‚Ä¢ Include proper type hints and docstring with examples
‚Ä¢ Handle edge cases and potential errors
‚Ä¢ Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and best practices
‚Ä¢ Add clear comments explaining the logic
‚Ä¢ Include example usage and test cases
‚Ä¢ Consider time and space complexity

Provide clean, production-ready code.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Two Enhancement Modes

**1. AI Mode (Enhanced)**
- Uses free Hugging Face transformer models
- Downloads models locally (one-time setup)
- Provides intelligent, context-aware improvements
- Works completely offline after initial download

**2. Smart Rules Mode (Fallback)**
- Uses advanced rule-based improvements
- Zero dependencies required
- Instant results
- Type-aware enhancements

### Automatic Fallback
If AI models aren't available, the tool automatically switches to smart rules mode - you always get improved prompts!

## üìä Supported Prompt Types

| Type | Examples | Improvements Added |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Coding** | "Write a function", "Debug this code" | Type hints, error handling, best practices |
| **Math** | "Calculate interest", "Solve equation" | Step-by-step requirements, verification |
| **Analysis** | "Compare options", "Analyze data" | Structure, evidence, multiple perspectives |
| **Creative** | "Write a story", "Design logo" | Originality, structure, engagement |
| **Explanation** | "Explain AI", "How does X work" | Clarity, examples, audience consideration |
| **Decision** | "Should I buy?", "Choose between" | Criteria, pros/cons, recommendations |

## üîß Command Options

```bash
python3 free_ai_improver.py [PROMPT] [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  PROMPT                    Prompt to improve

Options:
  --compare                 Show before/after comparison with metrics
  --examples                Display example improvements for different types
  --manual                  Skip AI mode and use smart rules only
  --help, -h               Show help message
```

## üì¶ Installation Options

### Option 1: Minimal (Rule-based only)
```bash
# No installation needed - just Python!
python3 free_ai_improver.py "Your prompt here"
```

### Option 2: Full AI Features
```bash
# Install transformer dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# First run downloads models (one-time, ~500MB)
python3 free_ai_improver.py "Your prompt here"
```

### Option 3: Docker (Coming Soon)
```bash
docker run -it free-ai-improver "Your prompt here"
```
